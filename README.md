## Venti

### Background
Venti is a puzzle game inspired by [Twenty](http://twenty.frenchguys.net/), in which players match blocks together in order to form higher numbers until reaching 20. It features a Tetris-like mechanic in which a row of blocks is added every few seconds, ending the game if the blocks reach the top of the screen.

### Functionality and MVP
Core functionality to this clone includes:
- [ ] Start, pause, and reset
- [ ] Brief tutorial or instructions
- [ ] User interaction by click-dragging blocks
- [ ] Win/loss conditions
- [ ] Timer mechanic
- [ ] Block generation and combination

Bonus features:
- [ ] Difficulty levels
- [ ] Multiplayer
- [ ] Styling blocks with a new theme

### Technologies
This project will be implemented using:
- JavaScript for core mechanics, timing, and logic
- React for user interaction
- CSS for theme and styling


### Implementation Timeline
**Phase 1**
Set up necessary libraries and node modules for user interaction and rendering. Write fundamental game logic (timer, win/loss conditions, block generation/combination) along with associated visual elements.

**Phase 2**
Add start, pause, and reset capabilities. Enable user interaction with blocks via click-dragging. Style interface to look clean and feel intuitive to user.

**Phase 3**
Add tutorial/instructions. Complete styling. If time permits, begin bonus features. Add difficulty levels (lower numbers generated automatically and presence of block links). Add multiplayer functionality.
